# CFV Deck Exporter

Export Cardfight!! Vanguard decks from Decklog to the Cardmarket format.

This extension allows you to quickly generate Want lists on Cardmarket in order to check prices or simply store a list of future purchases.

The extension simply goes through Decklog's HTML and generates the corresponding list.

## F.A.Q

### What are the supported formats?

Currently, only Standard (D) is supported.

### Can we expect more formats in the future?

Probably, it all depends on the way the Decklog HTML is structured. Premium and V Premium have a much larger pool of cards, and certain cards can be found in multiple formats, this creates complexity that might not be easy to implement if I don't take a few hours.
